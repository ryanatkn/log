						href="https://hci.social/@ryanatkn/109770113441485629">Mastodon</a
					>): Yeah! Here's how we're thinking about it right now with Felt. Still ratcheting up the
					ladder to climb out of the feudal hole.
				</p>
				<p>
					Control is held at the group/org/community level (Felt names these "hubs" now) by actors.
					In the default hub template the creator gets the all-powerful "steward" role, but the hub
					itself has an actor, and control is transferable/sharable. The hub actor's actions are
					controllable by automated/assisted/direct processes. Other group actors could be involved.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						to clarify, "steward" is just the name for a role in the default hub template and a
						convenient way to reference the idea, they can be constrained with fine-grained
						permissions like any other customizable role - this contrasts with Slack (no
						customizable roles) and Discord (coarse-grained permissions)
					</p>
					<p>
						given this API you could design a set of roles that split powers, separating/balancing
						concerns
					</p>
					<p>
						hub templates make it easy to share pre-fab designs with the initial
						roles/permissions/etc
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					In our implementation, actors are assigned roles which have permissions. You helped me
					realize that by splitting permissions among roles we could support non-absolute power with
					this: <a href="https://hci.social/@ryanatkn/109770994846184255"
						>hci.social/@ryanatkn/109770994846184255</a
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					An all-powerful group actor's actions could result from collective governance processes
				</p>
				<p>
					or, I think we can support designing systems with structural checks and balances through
					permission assignment, so any actors could have mutually co-checking subsets of
					permissions in a hub
				</p>
				<p>
					That's the first-order UX prioritized by end users. This second part is ignorable by most
					people most of the time, but for the governance enthusiast:
				</p>
				<p>
					Hubs are hosted on infrastructure controlled by "operator" actors. These have the power to
					pull the plug, and may technically have hub control bypassing stewards, like modifying a
					database.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe there's instance/server/etc levels between infra and hub, but that's an impl detail.
					Felt has instances controlled by "admins".
				</p>
				<p>
					The operator actor could be co-ops/nonprofits/other orgs, or as you've written about,
					bl0ckchains or similar. Bchain enthusiasm makes sense here b/c the operator won't pull the
					plug or modify the db barring acts of God. <a href="https://www.felt.social/"
						>Felt.social</a
					> plans to be a platform co-op operator providing infra.
				</p>
				<p>
					btw I love this so much, Boba Board (<a href="https://www.boba.social/">boba.social</a>)
					has leaned into *explicit* feudalism for their fandom communities, owning it right in the
					brand! "Be the Monarch of Your Own Realm!"

			<p>
				Oh hey I'm the Svelte Snake Sports author, thanks for the mention. A few things if anyone
				tries to learn from the the code:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The code is not refined at all. Some parts are pretty clean, but at the top level where
					the games are implemented, it's kind of a mess. If I had more time/energy I'd refactor a
					lot of things and figure out better interfaces. The goal was to support highly varying
					kinds of games, and I succeeded at getting my designs to work, but I wouldn't point
					beginners at the codebase to learn from unless they were very motivated and understood how
					weird some of it is.
				</li>
				<li>
					There's some experimentation with component instances exporting their objects for external
					access as an alternative to plain modules or stores -- in particular
					<a
						href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/svelte-snake-sports/blob/main/src/lib/SnakeGame.svelte"
						><code>$lib/SnakeGame.svelte</code></a
					>. That's why it has <code>{'<'}svelte:options accessors /></code> at the top. I wanted to
					be able to use Svelte's sweet component-level reactivity. The pattern works but it makes initialization
					much harder. I'm dubious about its value because of that.
				</li>
				<li>
					The REPL version is broken because some dependencies had major version bumps and the REPL
					is just importing from unpkg without versions. I was thinking I should bundle everything
					into a single script -- I have a fork of the repo for publishing to NPM for the REPL
					because it fails with types in the Svelte files. Pretty hacky all around. I thought the
					REPL version was important for the project to be more approachable but it's been a
					headache, mostly because of my own mistakes.
				</li>
				<li>
					I like the AI generated images (it took a <em>while</em> to get cute-looking snakes) but I
					probably won't do it in the future for this kind of project, I'd draw/code my own or pay artists
					instead.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It was a lot of fun to make though! I was needing a break from more serious work.</p>
			<p>
				Just tried it on mobile and it seems the tap location calculations are off if you're
				scrolled on the page, I know what I did wrong and will probably fix soon. It's also scaling
				weirdly when I scroll, darn.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also if you click "show settings" at the bottom you can change the map size and some other
				things. Lots of potential but I ran out of steam. I have a different <a
					href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/cosmicplayground">non-snake action game</a
				> that I'll probably work on instead when I have that itch to scratch. It has some gameplay but
				is unfinished/unpolished and it's not communicated well.

			<ul>
				<li>
					an opt-in way to better scale components - this has been mentioned by the team. I'd love
					to construct Svelte components from data without the compiler! I have no idea how feasible
					that is but it might be enabled by this feature. This could be a path for end users to
					"author" Svelte components without sandboxing or the compiler (with limits, but the way I
					do this today with an AST+component is much worse).

				<li>
					iterator support for <code>#each</code> or a similar construct (<code>#iterate</code>?
					it'd be nice to render sets/maps/etc without waste)

				<li>my two favorite RFCs are inline components and directive forwarding</li>
				<li>
					shorthand style properties <code>style:--some_css_var</code> (without the
					<code>={'{'}var}</code> part - I don't care about using kebab-case specifically for CSS vars,
					I think this wasn't implemented because of that, but +1 for snake_case CSS vars)
				</li>
				<li>
					whitespace handling (inherited from HTML, so very unlikely to change I think), sometimes
					significant whitespace causes problems, and the fix makes the code much less readable,
					it's one of the only things I miss from JSX
				</li>
				<li>
					I don't have specific suggestions but slots have some limitations that would be cool to
					see lifted
				</li>
				<li>
					the syntax to pass CSS vars directly to components breaks things like <code
						>:last-child</code
					> and other selectors, I think it may be an intractable problem tho
