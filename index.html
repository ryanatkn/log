			in response to a comment on
			<a href="https://seldo.com/posts/the_case_for_frameworks">&quot;The case for frameworks&quot;</a>
			by Laurie Voss which responds to
			<a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">&quot;The Market For Lemons&quot;</a>
			by Alex Russell, where I describe what I see as two major changes in JavaScript framework design
			that advance the state of the art beyond <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a> (and as usual
			I shill for
			<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>):
		</p>
		<blockquote><p>I see two important paradigm shifts away from React. For context I used React for 6 years
				until switching to Svelte in 2019, and I build JS-heavy long-session experiences optimizing
				UX for incremental updates.
			</p>
			<ol><li>How does the framework run _your_ code? Is it re-creating entire components on any change
					or setting things up once on mount? (and their subtrees, depending on optimizations) Or is
					it just re-running the bits of your code that need to deal with the change?
				</li>
				<li>Does the framework ship as a large monolith, or do you get near-optimal output for small
					websites?
				</li></ol>
			<p>For 1), this is where Svelte, Vue, and Solid shine. This doesn&#39;t matter for simple websites,
				but it&#39;s where an order of magnitude+ of performance difference can creep in with
				rerun-everything frameworks like React. This doesn&#39;t show up on the popular benchmarks, and
				I think it&#39;s the main reason e.g. Reddit is terribly slow. Careful programming can mitigate
				this, but I think it&#39;s a genuine paradigm shift, because we&#39;ll never have the web we want if
				we expect framework users to all program carefully.
			</p>
			<p>For 2), this is where Svelte, Solid, and Preact (because of its size) shine.</p>
			<p>It&#39;s impossible to generalize this stuff to every experience, because performance
				characteristics can be completely different. For 1), setting up subscriptions on mount may
				be worse if the entire page is changing every time a change happens. It really depends on
				your app.
			</p>
			<p>I liked both this article and <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">The Market for Lemons</a> which it&#39;s replying to, and I hope for the web&#39;s sake (as opposed to the native app world,
				with its high-barrier proprietary walled gardens that isolate content and people from an open
				ecosystem) that React becomes less used in places where it&#39;s egregiously non-optimal. (which
				is a lot of places)

				<a href="https://mediarxiv.org/sf432/">ntnsndr.in/ImplicitFeudalism</a> in mind, I&#39;m curious
				whether there is any possibility of checking the power of Control? Is there a way in which that

			</blockquote>
			<blockquote><p><a href="https://hci.social/@ryanatkn">@ryanatkn@hci.social</a> (<a href="https://hci.social/@ryanatkn/109770113441485629">Mastodon</a>): Yeah! Here&#39;s how we&#39;re thinking about it right now with Felt. Still ratcheting up the
					ladder to climb out of the feudal hole.
				</p>
				<p>Control is held at the group/org/community level (Felt names these &quot;hubs&quot; now) by actors.
					In the default hub template the creator gets the all-powerful &quot;steward&quot; role, but the hub
					itself has an actor, and control is transferable/sharable. The hub actor&#39;s actions are
					controllable by automated/assisted/direct processes. Other group actors could be involved.
				</p>
				<blockquote><p>to clarify, &quot;steward&quot; is just the name for a role in the default hub template and a
						convenient way to reference the idea, they can be constrained with fine-grained
						permissions like any other customizable role - this contrasts with Slack (no
						customizable roles) and Discord (coarse-grained permissions)
					</p>
					<p>given this API you could design a set of roles that split powers, separating/balancing
						concerns
					</p>
					<p>hub templates make it easy to share pre-fab designs with the initial
						roles/permissions/etc
					</p></blockquote>
				<p>In our implementation, actors are assigned roles which have permissions. You helped me
					realize that by splitting permissions among roles we could support non-absolute power with
					this: <a href="https://hci.social/@ryanatkn/109770994846184255">hci.social/@ryanatkn/109770994846184255</a></p>
				<p>An all-powerful group actor&#39;s actions could result from collective governance processes
				</p>
				<p>or, I think we can support designing systems with structural checks and balances through
					permission assignment, so any actors could have mutually co-checking subsets of
					permissions in a hub
				</p>
				<p>That&#39;s the first-order UX prioritized by end users. This second part is ignorable by most
					people most of the time, but for the governance enthusiast:
				</p>
				<p>Hubs are hosted on infrastructure controlled by &quot;operator&quot; actors. These have the power to
					pull the plug, and may technically have hub control bypassing stewards, like modifying a
					database.
				</p>
				<p>Maybe there&#39;s instance/server/etc levels between infra and hub, but that&#39;s an impl detail.
					Felt has instances controlled by &quot;admins&quot;.
				</p>
				<p>The operator actor could be co-ops/nonprofits/other orgs, or as you&#39;ve written about,
					bl0ckchains or similar. Bchain enthusiasm makes sense here b/c the operator won&#39;t pull the
					plug or modify the db barring acts of God. <a href="https://www.felt.social/">Felt.social</a> plans to be a platform co-op operator providing infra.
				</p>
				<p>btw I love this so much, Boba Board (<a href="https://www.boba.social/">boba.social</a>)
					has leaned into *explicit* feudalism for their fandom communities, owning it right in the
					brand! &quot;Be the Monarch of Your Own Realm!&quot;

			about <a href="https://ryanatkn.github.io/svelte-snake-sports">svelte🐍snake🐍sports</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/svelte-snake-sports">source</a>) on aliensite:
		</p>
		<blockquote><p>Oh hey I&#39;m the Svelte Snake Sports author, thanks for the mention. A few things if anyone
				tries to learn from the the code:
			</p>
			<ul><li>The code is not refined at all. Some parts are pretty clean, but at the top level where
					the games are implemented, it&#39;s kind of a mess. If I had more time/energy I&#39;d refactor a
					lot of things and figure out better interfaces. The goal was to support highly varying
					kinds of games, and I succeeded at getting my designs to work, but I wouldn&#39;t point
					beginners at the codebase to learn from unless they were very motivated and understood how
					weird some of it is.
				</li>
				<li>There&#39;s some experimentation with component instances exporting their objects for external
					access as an alternative to plain modules or stores -- in particular
					<a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/svelte-snake-sports/blob/main/src/lib/SnakeGame.svelte"><code>$lib/SnakeGame.svelte</code></a>. That&#39;s why it has <code>&lt;svelte:options accessors /&gt;</code> at the top. I wanted to
					be able to use Svelte&#39;s sweet component-level reactivity. The pattern works but it makes initialization
					much harder. I&#39;m dubious about its value because of that.
				</li>
				<li>The REPL version is broken because some dependencies had major version bumps and the REPL
					is just importing from unpkg without versions. I was thinking I should bundle everything
					into a single script -- I have a fork of the repo for publishing to NPM for the REPL
					because it fails with types in the Svelte files. Pretty hacky all around. I thought the
					REPL version was important for the project to be more approachable but it&#39;s been a
					headache, mostly because of my own mistakes.
				</li>
				<li>I like the AI generated images (it took a <em>while</em> to get cute-looking snakes) but I
					probably won&#39;t do it in the future for this kind of project, I&#39;d draw/code my own or pay artists
					instead.
				</li></ul>
			<p>It was a lot of fun to make though! I was needing a break from more serious work.</p>
			<p>Just tried it on mobile and it seems the tap location calculations are off if you&#39;re
				scrolled on the page, I know what I did wrong and will probably fix soon. It&#39;s also scaling
				weirdly when I scroll, darn.
			</p>
			<p>Also if you click &quot;show settings&quot; at the bottom you can change the map size and some other
				things. Lots of potential but I ran out of steam. I have a different <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/cosmicplayground">non-snake action game</a> that I&#39;ll probably work on instead when I have that itch to scratch. It has some gameplay but
				is unfinished/unpolished and it&#39;s not communicated well.

		</p>
		<blockquote><ul><li>an opt-in way to better scale components - this has been mentioned by the team. I&#39;d love
					to construct Svelte components from data without the compiler! I have no idea how feasible
					that is but it might be enabled by this feature. This could be a path for end users to
					&quot;author&quot; Svelte components without sandboxing or the compiler (with limits, but the way I
					do this today with an AST+component is much worse).
				</li>
				<li>iterator support for <code>#each</code> or a similar construct (<code>#iterate</code>?
					it&#39;d be nice to render sets/maps/etc without waste)
				</li>
				<li>my two favorite RFCs are inline components and directive forwarding</li>
				<li>shorthand style properties <code>style:--some_css_var</code> (without the
					<code>={var}</code> part - I don&#39;t care about using kebab-case specifically for CSS vars,
					I think this wasn&#39;t implemented because of that, but +1 for snake_case CSS vars)
				</li>
				<li>whitespace handling (inherited from HTML, so very unlikely to change I think), sometimes
					significant whitespace causes problems, and the fix makes the code much less readable,
					it&#39;s one of the only things I miss from JSX
				</li>
				<li>I don&#39;t have specific suggestions but slots have some limitations that would be cool to
					see lifted
				</li>
				<li>the syntax to pass CSS vars directly to components breaks things like <code>:last-child</code> and other selectors, I think it may be an intractable problem tho
